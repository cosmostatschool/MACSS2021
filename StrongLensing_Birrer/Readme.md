# Strong gravitational lensing

The phenomena of strong gravitational lensing, the bending of light due to gravity, such that multiple images of the same background source appear, has provided insights into the nature of dark matter and the expansion history of the universe.

The goal of this three-part series is to learn the basics of strong lensing and the methodology and gain familiarity with simulating and modeling distorted images. We will go through exercises and interactively learn about different science cases and techniques employed.

The notebooks are accessible [at this github repository](https://github.com/sibirrer/strong_lensing_lectures).
