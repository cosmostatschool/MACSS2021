# Strong gravitational lensing

The phenomena of strong gravitational lensing, the bending of light due to gravity, such that multiple images of the same background source appear, has provided insights into the nature of dark matter and the expansion history of the universe.

The goal of this three-part series is to learn the basics of strong lensing and the methodology and gain familiarity with simulating and modeling distorted images. We will go through exercises and interactively learn about different science cases and techniques employed.

The notebooks are accessible [at this github repository](https://github.com/sibirrer/strong_lensing_lectures).
Lenstronomy source code is [here](https://github.com/sibirrer/lenstronomy)

## First lecture (Tuesday June 29th)

- Slides [Introduction slides day 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-tAjqBo40p1CrwfP75MlRUQyniuaRaIf/view?usp=sharing)
- Intro notebook [![Intro notebook in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sibirrer/strong_lensing_lectures/blob/main/Lectures/SL_basics.ipynb)

Homework (for Thursday):
- Play around with the notebook of day one, familiarize yourself with the formalism and note questions you have. 
- Install lenstronomy and required software locally to run the notebook on your own machine
- (optional) find and suggest a topic in strong lensing that you are interested in to work on a mini-project
