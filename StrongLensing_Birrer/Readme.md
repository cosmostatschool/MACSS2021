# Strong gravitational lensing

The phenomena of strong gravitational lensing, the bending of light due to gravity, such that multiple images of the same background source appear, has provided insights into the nature of dark matter and the expansion history of the universe.

The goal of this three-part series is to learn the basics of strong lensing and the methodology and gain familiarity with simulating and modeling distorted images. We will go through exercises and interactively learn about different science cases and techniques employed.

The notebooks are accessible [at this github repository](https://github.com/sibirrer/strong_lensing_lectures).
Lenstronomy source code is [here](https://github.com/sibirrer/lenstronomy)

The version of the notebooks being used in this specific lecture are with the release [here](https://github.com/sibirrer/strong_lensing_lectures/releases/tag/v1.1)
and making use of lenstronomy version 1.8.2.


## First lecture (Tuesday June 29th)

- Slides [Introduction slides day 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-tAjqBo40p1CrwfP75MlRUQyniuaRaIf/view?usp=sharing)
- lecture I: lensing basics [![lecture I notebook in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sibirrer/strong_lensing_lectures/blob/main/Lectures/lensing_basics_I.ipynb)

Homework (for Thursday):
- Play around with the notebook of day one, familiarize yourself with the formalism and note questions you have. 
- Install lenstronomy and required software locally to run the notebook on your own machine
- (optional) find and suggest a topic in strong lensing that you are interested in to work on a mini-project


## Second lecture (Thursday July 1st)

- lecture II: lensing observables and degeneracies [![lecture II notebook in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sibirrer/strong_lensing_lectures/blob/main/Lectures/lensing_observables_II.ipynb)
- lecture III: lens modelling [![lecture III notebook in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sibirrer/strong_lensing_lectures/blob/main/Lectures/einstein_ring_III.ipynb)

Homework (for Friday):
- change the lensing configuration in the notebook of lecture III and run (and save) the model fit and posterior inference


## Third lecture (Friday July 2nd)

- Slides [Wrap-up slides day 3](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QiaUxOj3fcIkm6aQJrbh82igRZtrDQy5/view?usp=sharing)
- substructure imaging modeling notebook [![substructure notebook in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sibirrer/strong_lensing_lectures/blob/main/Examples/substructure_imaging.ipynb)


Homework (optional):
- experiment with different observational settings and substructure mass to figure out under which conditions with the modeling assumptions of the notebook you can detect a signature. (substructure notebook)
